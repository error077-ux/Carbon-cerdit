# Carbon Credit System Using Blockchain

The **Carbon Credit System Using Blockchain** is a platform that utilizes blockchain technology to track and trade carbon credits. The system allows farmers and renewable energy producers to earn **CC Tokens** for generating renewable energy. The government acts as a centralized authority to monitor transactions and ensure transparency, using PoS and PoA algorithms.

## Features

- **Carbon Credit Tokenization**: Farmers and renewable energy producers earn **CC Tokens** for generating renewable energy (e.g., solar power).
- **Transparent Transactions**: Blockchain ensures transparent tracking and trading of carbon credits.
- **Government Oversight**: The government uses PoS/PoA algorithms to monitor and verify transactions.
- **Sustainability**: The platform incentivizes the adoption of renewable energy and helps combat climate change.

## Technologies Used

- **Blockchain**: Ethereum, Solidity
- **Smart Contracts**: For carbon credit token creation and transactions
- **Consensus Algorithms**: Proof of Stake (PoS), Proof of Authority (PoA)
- **Frontend**: React.js, HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js
- **Database**: MongoDB
- **Hosting**: AWS, IPFS for decentralized file storage
